The Egyptian, the Mesopotamian, the
Chinese and the Indus were the important
early civilisations

During
the time of these civilisations, South India
witnessed the emergence of Neolithic agropastoral
communities and Microlithic form of
life by hunter-gatherers. 

The Egyptian Civilisation

As one of the oldest civilisations,
the Egyptian civilisation is known for its
monumental architecture, agriculture, arts,
sciences and crafts at a very early age.

Egypt lies in the north-eastern corner
of the African continent. It is bounded by the
Red Sea on the east and Mediterranean Sea in
the north. Egypt is irrigated by the River Nile,which originates in Lake Victoria in the south
and flows into the Mediterranean Sea in the north.

The Egyptian civilisation depended solely
upon the flow of Nile River, and hence Egypt
was called the Gift of Nile by the Greek historian
Herodotus.

The Nile also served as a means of
transport. The Nile valley is very rich and fertile
as the river deposits fresh alluvium every year.

The dry
regions on both the sides of the Niles, however
remained deserts

Egypt became intimately connected with
the Sangam Age Tamilagam by the sea route

The Hyksos were the rulers of the 15th dynasty
of Egypt and they were probably from West Asia.
Persians are the people from the region of
Persia, the ancient Iran.
Greek refers to the language and people of
modern-day State of Greece in Europe.
Rome refers to the ancient Roman Empire,
which had as its capital the city of Rome in Italy

The Egyptian king was known as the
Pharaoh. The people treated pharaoh as a divine form.

Under the pharaoh, there was a hierarchy
of officials including viziers, the governors
of provinces, local mayors and tax collectors.
The entire social system was supported by the
work and production of artisans including
stone cutters, masons, potters, carpenters,
coppersmiths and goldsmiths, peasants and
workers. Land belonged to the king and was
assigned to the officials. Slavery was not
common, but captives were used as slaves.

Viziers were the high officials who
administered territories under the direction
of the Pharaohs.
The Egyptians believed in life after death.
Therefore, they preserved the dead body. The
art of preserving the dead body is known as
mummification. Pyramids and tombs were built
to preserve the body of pharaohs.

The famous Egyptian pharaoh
Tutankhamen’s (who ruled from 1332 to 1322
BC (BCE)) tomb with a rich variety of offerings
is located near Luxor in Egypt. The mask of
his mummy made of gold and decorated with
precious stones is an important artefact of the
Egyptian civilisation

The Egyptians cultivated wheat, barley,
millets, vegetables, fruits, papyrus and cotton.
Papyrus was used for making rope mats sandals
and later for producing paper. They domesticated
cattle, sheep, goat and pigs, and hunted wild
animals. They had pets such as dogs, cats and
monkeys. The Egyptians had trade relations
with Lebanon, Crete, Phoenicia, Palestine and
Syria. Gold, silver and ivory were imported, and
they acquired the Lapis Lazuli, a precious stone
of bluish colour, from Afghanistan

The preserved dead
body is called the
mummy. The Egyptians
had the tradition of
preserving the dead
bodies using Natron salt,
a combination of sodium carbonate and
sodium bicarbonate. The preservation
process is called mummification. After
40 days, when the salt absorbed all the
moisture, the body was filled with sawdust
and wrapped with strips of linen cloth and
covered with a fabric. The body was stored
in a stone coffin called sarcophagus.

The pyramids are massive monuments
built as tombs of mourning to the Pharaohs.
The great pyramids near Cairo are known as the
Giza Pyramids

The Great Sphinx of Giza is a massive limestone image of a lion with a human head. It is dated to the time of Pharaoh Khafre. It is one of the largest sculptures of the world and measures seventy three metres in length and twenty metres in height

The Egyptians practiced polytheism. Amon, Re, Seth, Th oth, Horus and Anubis are some of the Gods of Egyptians. Th ey worshipped many Gods, but the Sun God, Re, was the predominant one. Later on, the Sun God was called Amon.

Sundial, water clock and glass were developed by the Egyptians.

They devised a solar calendar that consisted of twelve months of thirty days each, with five days added to the end of a year.

This calendar was introduced as early as 4200 BC (BCE).

The Egyptians are well known for their writing system. Their form of writing is known as hieroglyphic. Hieroglyphic was used in the inscriptions on seals and other objects. The heretic, an another form of writing, was used for common purposes. This form of writing used a pictogram-based system. It was developed around 3000 BC (BCE) and many texts and books were written using this script. Now this inscription is on display in the British Museum, London.

Th e Egyptians developed a solar calendar system.
Th e pyramids and their designs show their
mathematical and surveying skills.
Hieroglyphic writing system attests to their
skills in handling symbols.
Preservation of human body in the form of
Mummies.
Th ey applied innovation in the use of science and technology.

The word ‘paper’ comes from
‘Papyrus’. The Egyptians wrote
on the leaves of a plant called
papyrus, a kind of reed, which
grew on the banks of Nile.

The Mesopotamian
Civilisations

Mesopotamia refers to the region of Iraq
and Kuwait in West Asia. Several kingdoms
emerged around the city states of this region
from the early third millennium BC (BCE). The
Sumerian, Akkadian, Babylonian and Assyrian
civilisations flourished in Mesopotamia.

Geography
In the Greek language, meso means
‘in between’ and potamus means river. The
Euphrates and Tigris flow here and drain into the
Persian Gulf is since this area is in between two
rivers it is known as Mesopotamia. The northern
part of Mesopotamia is known as Assyria, and
the southern part is called Babylonia.

The Sumerians
The oldest civilisation in Mesopotamia
belonged to the Sumerians. The Sumerians were
the contemporaries of the people of Indus and
the Egyptian civilisations.
civilisations had trade connections

The Sumerians settled in the
Lower Tigris valley around 5,000 to 4,000 BC
(BCE). They were believed to have originated
from Central Asia. They founded many cities
and Nippur was one of the important cities. They
developed the cuneiform writing system. During
the early phase of the Sumerian civilisation,
Kings acted as the chief priests. Their political
domination came to an end by 2,450 BC (BCE).

The Akkadians

The Akkadians dominated Sumeria briefly
from 2450 to 2250 BC (BCE). The Sargon of
Akkad was a famous ruler. The Sargon and his
descendants (ca.2334–2218 BC (BCE)) ruled
Mesopotamia for more than hundred years. In
the cuneiform records of Akkadians, mention
is made about the Indus civilisation. The
documents of the Sargon of Akkad (2334–2279
BC (BCE)) refer to the ships from Meluhha,
Magan and Dilmun in the quay of Akkad.
The city of Akkad later
became the city of Babylon,
a commercial and cultural
centre of West Asia.

The Babylonians
The Semitic people called Amorites from
the Arabian desert moved into Mesopotamia.
They were known as the Babylonians as they established a kingdom and made Babylon its
capital. By the time of the king Hammurabi,
they extended their domination to the western
part of Mesopotamia. The powerful states of Ur
(2112 to 2004 BC (BCE)) and Babylon (1792
to 1712 BC (BCE)) controlled this region. The
hero Gilgamesh referred to in the first ever epic
on the earth may have been a king of Sumeria.
Hammurabi, the sixth king of Babylon belonging
to the first Amorite dynasty (1792–1750 BC
(BCE)), attained fame as a great law-maker.

The Assyrians
The Assyrian Empire was politically
active in Mesopotamia around 1000 BC
(BCE). The Assyrian kings were the priests of
Ashur, the chief deity of Assyria. The Assyrian
government was controlled by the emperor and
provincial governors were
appointed by the emperor
to administer provinces.
Assur was the capital city
of Assyria. Ashurbanipal
was a popular ruler of
the late or neo-Assyrian
empire (ca. 668 to 627
BC (BCE)). He maintained a famous library of
cuneiform records. The Assyrians worshipped
the deity of Lamassu for protection.

Society, State and Administration
The Sumerian civilisation had many city
states. A typical Sumerian city was surroundedby cultivable lands. The fortified Sumerian cities
had the temples called Ziggurats at its centre.
The temple was controlled by the priests. Priests,
scribes and nobles were part of the government.
The rulers and priests occupied the top of the
social hierarchy. The ruler performed the role
of the chief priest. The scribes, merchants and
artisans were placed next in the hierarchy. The
scribes maintained the account of the taxes
and the priests collected the taxes. The temples
acted as storehouses of the taxed commodities.
Assemblies were created for the administration
of the state. Cultivable lands were owned by the
kings and the higher classes of people in the
hierarchy. The peasants who remained to the
temples in the earlier phase of Mesopotamian
civilisation, became free from that association
in the later period. Not all people were allowed
to live in the cities.

The Assyrian Empire was the first
military State in history. They
emerged militarily powerful
because they were the earliest to
use iron technology effectively

Agriculture was the main occupation of the
Mesopotamians. They had developed irrigation
systems for ensuring the availability of water
for agriculture and cultivated wheat, barley,
onions, turnips, grapes, apples and dates. They
domesticated cattle, sheep and goats. Fish was
part of their diet.

They traded with Syria and Asia Minor in the West, and in Iran and
the Indus Valley civilisation in the east
The Mesopotamian documents
have references to loan and repayment, with or
without interest. Perhaps this is the first written
evidence of charging an interest on borrowed
money

Cities and Town Planning
The Mesopotamian cities featured mud or
baked brick walls with gates. Some people lived
in reed huts outside the cities. The Ziggurats were
at the city centre on a platform and appeared
like steep pyramids, with staircases leading to
the top. Around this temple were complexes of
ceremonial courtyards, shrines, burial chambers
for the priests and priestesses, ceremonial
banquet halls, along with workshops, granaries,
storehouses and administrative building





Indus Civilisation

The Indus or Harappan civilisation,
1.5 million square kilometres in India and Pakistan. 
Sutkagen-Dor in the west on the Pakistan–Iran border 
Shortugai (Afghanistan) in the north 
Alamgirpur (Uttar Pradesh in India) in the east 
Daimabad (Maharashtra in India) in the south.

Its main concentration is in the regions of Gujarat, Pakistan, Rajasthan and Haryana.

Harappa		(Punjab,	Pakistan),
Mohenjo-Daro 	(Sindh,		Pakistan),

Rakhigarhi	(Haryana,	India), 
Kalibangan 	(Rajasthan,	India), 
Banawali	(Rajasthan, 	India,) 
Lothal 		(Gujarat, 	India),
Dholavira	(Gujarat, 	India), 
Surkotada 	(Gujarat, 	India)- major cities of the Indus civilisation.

Fortification,
well-planned streets and lanes and drainages can be observed in the Harappan towns. 

The Harappans used baked and unbaked bricks and stones for construction. 

A male image from Mohenjo-Daro- identified as ‘priest king’.
The Indus Valley civilisation is also known as the Harappan civilisation,  since Harappa was the first site to be discovered.

Agriculture and Animal Domestication

The Harappans practiced agriculture. 
cultivated wheat, barley and various types of millets. 
adopted a double cropping system.
Pastoralism was also known to them. 
reared cattle, sheep and goats. 
had knowledge of various animals including elephants, but did not use "horses". 
The Harappan cattle are called Zebu, and it is a large breed, often represented in their seals.


Pottery

The Harappans used painted pottery.
Their potteries have a deep red slip and black paintings. 
The pottery has shapes like 
dish-onstands,
storage jars, 
perforated jars, 
goblets,
S-shaped jars,
plates, 
dishes,
bowls and pots.

The painted motifs,generally noticed on the pottery, 
depict "pipal tree leaves", 
fish-scale designs,
intersecting circles,
zigzag lines,
horizontal bands,
geometrical motifs,
floral and faunal patterns.

Metal Tools and Weapons

The Harappans used  chert blades, copper objects and bone and ivory tools. 
They did not possess knowledge about iron. 
The tools and equipments such as 
points, 
chisels, 
needles,
fishhooks, 
razors, 
weighing pans, 
mirror and
antimony rods were made of bronze. 
The chisels made out of Rohri chert were used by the Harappans.
Their weapons included arrows,spears,a chisel-bladed tool and axe. 
The bronze image of dancing girl from Mohenjo-Daro is suggestive of the use of lost-wax process.
Rohri chert refers to the chert raw material collected from Rohri in Pakistan. 
It was used by the Harappans for making blades.
The Harappans used both stone and bronze tools.

The Harappans used metal and stone ornaments.
They had knowledge of cotton and silk textiles.
They made carnelian, copper and gold ornaments. 
Faience, stoneware and shell bangles were also used. 
Some of them had etched designs, and the Harappans exported
them to the Mesopotamia.

The Harappans had close trade links with the Mesopotamians. 
Harappan seals have been found in the West Asian sites namely

Oman,
Bahrain, 
Iraq and
Iran. 
The cuneiform inscriptions mention the trade contacts between
Mesopotamia and the Harappans. 
The mention of ‘Meluhha’ in the cuneiform inscriptions is considered to refer to the Indus region.

Weights and Measures

The cubical chert weights are found at the Harappan sites. 
The copper plates for weighing balances have also been found.
The weights point to their knowledge of the binary system. 
The ratio of weighing is doubled as 1:2:4:8:16:32.

Seals, Sealings and Scripts

The seals from various media such as 
steatite,
copper,
terracotta and
ivory are found in the Harappan sites. 
They were probably used in the trade activities.

Arts and Amusement

The terracotta figurines, paintings on the pottery and 
the bronze images from the Harappan sites suggest the artistic skills of the Harappans. 
‘Priest king’ made of steatite and 
'dancing girl' made of bronze (both from Mohenjo-Daro) 
as well as stone sculptures from Harappa, Mohenjo-Daro and Dholavira are the important objects of art. 
Toy carts, rattles, wheels, tops, marbles and hop scotches made in terracotta suggest the amusement of the Harappan people

Religion

The Indus people had a close relationship with nature. 
They worshipped pipal trees
Fire altars have been identifi ed at Kalibangan. 
The Indus people buried the dead.
Burials were done elaborately and evidence for cremation has also been found.

The period of the civilisation has been divided into 
Early Harappan, starting around 3300 BC (BCE) and continuing to 2600 BC (BCE) and mature Harappan, are the last phase civilisation from 2600 to 1900 BC (BCE). 
The later Harappan existed upto 1700 BC (BCE).

The Indus civilisation and its urban features started declining from about 1900 BC (BCE). 
Changes in climate, decline of the trade with Mesopotamia and drying up or flooding of the river Indus, 
foreign invasion were some of the reasons attributed to the collapse of this
civilisation and for the migration of people in the southern and eastern directions. 
It did not completely disappear. 
It continued as rural culture.

The script is found on seals, in moulded terracotta and on
pottery 
Because the Indus texts are very short, the average length of the inscription is less than five signs. 
It has no bilingual text (like a Rosetta stone written in Egyptian and Greek).

It was written generally from right to left.
• Based on computer analysis, the Russian scholar Yuri Knorozov suggested that the Indus
inscriptions have a Dravidian-like word order.
• Scholar and researcher Iravatham Mahadevan, who has done extensive research on Indus
civilisation, says, “We may hopefully find that the proto Dravidian roots of Harappa language and
South Indian Dravidian languages are similar.”
• According to Mahadevan, a stone Celt discovered in Mayiladuthurai (Tamil Nadu) has same
marking as that of the symbol of the Indus script.
• In May 2007, the TamilNadu Archaeology Department found pots with arrow head symbols at
Melaperumpallam near Poompuhar, which resembled the seals in Mohenjo-Daro.

According to Parpola, the sign of the Indus script is likely to represent Dravidian mono-syllabic roots

After the Neolithic Age, civilisations
sprang and grew in the Bronze Age.

People began their settled life in
planned towns and began to involve
in trade and exchange. Science and
technology developed.

The civilisations are relatively complex
social systems.
the Egyptian civilisation excelled in
architecture and the pyramids were its
important contribution.

The Mesopotamian civilisation
contributed to the development of
calendar system and astronomy.

the Chinese civilisation contributed
in terms of philosophy and inventions.

The Indus civilisation produced
a variety of commodities using
innovative techniques. It had cultural
contacts with West Asia.
