People preferred to settle near the rivers for the reasons given below. ¾
The soil is fertile. ¾
Fresh water is available for drinking, watering livestock and irrigation. ¾
Easy movement of people and goods is possible.

The ruins of Harappa were first described by the British East India Company soldier and explorer 
Charles Masson in his book. 

When he visited the North-West Frontier Province which is now in Pakistan, he came across some mysterious brick mounds. He wrote that he saw a 

“ruined brick castle with very high walls and towers built on a hill”. 

This was the earliest historical record of the existence of Harappa.

In 1856-railway line-Lahore to Karachi-more burnt bricks-for laying the rail road.

1920s archaeologists began to excavate the cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-Daro. 

In 1924 the Director General of ASI, 

Sir John Marshall, 
common features between Harappa and Mohenjo-Daro.
He concluded that they were part of a large civilisation.

Some slight differences are found in the earthenwares of Harappa and Mohenjo-Daro. 
This made the researchers conclude that Harappa was older than Mohenjo-Daro.

The Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) was started in 1861 
with Alexander Cunningham as Surveyor. 
Its headquarters is located in New Delhi.

Sites in indian Borders:



Time Span of Indus Civilisation
Geographical range: South Asia
Period: Bronze Age
Time: 3300 to1900 BCE (determined using the radiocarbon dating method)
Area: 13 lakh sq.km
Cities: 6 big cities
Villages: More than 200

Harappan civilisation is said to be urban 
because of the following reasons. 

¾ Well-conceived town planning 
¾ Astonishing masonry and architecture
¾ Priority for hygiene and public health
¾ Standardised weights and measures 
¾ Solid agricultural and artisanal base

Unique Features of Harappan Civilisation
Town planning is a unique feature of the Indus Civilisation. 
The Harappan city had two planned areas

HarappaTwo planned areas of
 
upper town

The part of the city to the "west" was higher and it was called "citadel" 
It was usedby the administrators
Great Bath and Granaries are located 

Lower town

The part of the city to the "east" was lower but larger
It was inhabited by common people


Mehergarh – the Precursor to Indus Civilisation
Mehergarh is a Neolithic site. 
It is located near the Bolan Basin of Balochistan in Pakistan. 
It is one of the earliest sites known. 
It shows evidence of farming and herding done by man in very early times. 
Archaeological evidence suggests that Neolithic culture existed in Mehergarh as early as 7000 BCE


The streets are observed to have a grid pattern.
They were straight running from north to south and east to west and intersected each other at right angles.
The roads were wide with rounded corners. 
Houses were built on both sides of the street.
The houses were either one or two storeys. 
Most of the houses had many rooms, a courtyard and a well.
Each house had toilets and bathrooms. 
The houses were built using baked bricks and mortar.
Sun-dried bricks were also used.
Most of the bricks were of uniform size.
Roofs were flat. 
There is no conclusive evidence of the presense of palaces or places of worship.

Bronze Age
It is a historical period characterised by the use of articles made of bronze.

Drainage System ¾
Many of these cities had covered drains. The drains were covered with slabs or bricks. ¾
Each drain had a gentle slope so that water could flow. ¾
Holes were provided at regular intervals to clear the drains.
House drains passed below many lanes before finally emptying into the main drains. ¾
Every house had its own soak pit, which collected all the sediments and allowed only the water to flow into the street drain

¾The Great Bath Mohenjadaro
The great bath was a large, rectangular tank in a courtyard. It may be the earliest example of a water-proof structure. ¾
The bath was lined with bricks, coated with plaster and made water-tight using layers of natural bitumen. ¾
There were steps on the north and south leading into the tank. There were rooms on three sides. ¾
Water was drawn from the well located in the courtyard and drained out after use.

The Great Granary ¾ Harappa
The granary was a massive building with a solid brick foundation.
Granaries were used to store food grain. ¾
The remains of 
wheat, barley, millets, sesame and pulses have been found there.

A granary with walls made of mud bricks,
which are still in a good condition,
has been discovered in Rakhigarhi,a village in Haryana, 
belonging to Mature Harappan Phase.


The Assembly Hall
The Assembly Hall was another huge public building at" Mohenjo-Daro". 
It was a multi-pillared hall (20 pillars in 4 rows to support the roof).

 
Trade and Transport ¾
Harappans were great traders. ¾
Standardised weights and measures were used by them. They used sticks with marks to measure length

They used carts with spokeless solid wheels.

There is evidence for extensive maritime trade with Mesopotamia. Indus Seals have been found as far as Mesopotamia (Sumer) which are modern-day Iraq, Kuwait and parts of Syria. 

King Naram-Sin of Akkadian Empire (Sumerian) has written about buying jewellery from the land of Melukha (a region of the Indus Valley).

Cylindrical seals similar to those found in Persian Gulf and Mesopotamia have also been found in the Indus area. 
This shows the trade links between these two areas.
A naval dockyard has been discovered in Lothal in Gujarat. It shows the maritime activities of the Indus people

Dockyard(a place where ships were built and repaired) at Lothal

Lothal is situated on the banks of a tributary of Sabarmati river in Gujarat.

Leader in Mohenjo-Daro ¾
A sculpture of a seated male has been unearthed in a building, with a "head band on the forehead"
and a smaller ornament on "the right upper arm".

His hair is carefully combed, and beard finely trimmed. ¾
Two holes beneath the ears suggest that the head ornament might have been attached till the ear. ¾
The "left shoulder" is covered with a shawl-like garment decorated with designs of flowers and rings. ¾
This shawl pattern is used by people even today in those areas.

Technology 

Ivory scale found in Lothal in Gujarat is 1704mm 
(the smallest division ever recorded on a scale of other contemporary civilisations).

The word ‘civilisation’ comes from the ancient Latin word civis, which means ‘city’.

This little statue was found at Mohenjo-Daro. When Sir John Marshall saw the statuette known as the dancing girl, he said, “When I first saw them I found it difficult to believe that they were pre-historic modeling. Such as this was unknown in the ancient worlds up to the age of Greece. I thought that these figures had found their way into levels some 3000 years old to which they properly belonged”.

KVT Complex (Korkai-Vanji-Thondi) spread over Afghanistan and Pakistan has many places, names of those were mentioned in sangam literature.
Korkai, Vanji, Tondi, Matrai, Urai and Kudalgarh are the names of places in Pakistan.
Gurkay and Pumpuhar in Afghanistan are related to the cities and ports mentioned in the Sangam Age. The names of the rivers Kawri and Poruns in Afghanistan and the rivers Kaweri Wala and Phornai in Pakistan also occur in the Sangam literature

So far, the Indus script has not been deciphered. Therefore,

Cotton fabrics were in common use. 
Clay spindles unearthed suggest that yarn was spun. 
Wool was also used.

Love and peace 
Settlements were built on giant platforms and elevated grounds. 
The Indus Civilisation seems to have been a peaceful one. Few weapons were found and there is no evidence of an army. 
They displayed their status with garments and precious jewellery. 
They had an advanced civic sense.

Ornaments 
Ornaments were popular among men and women. 
They adorned themselves with necklaces, armlets, bangles, finger rings, ear studs and anklets. 
The ornaments were made of gold, silver, ivory, shell, copper, terracotta and precious stones.

Iron was unknown to people of Indus.

Indus people used the red quartz stone called Carnelian to design jewellery.

Copper was the first metal discovered and used by humans.

Who Governed them?
Historians believe that there existed a central authority that controlled planning of towns and overseas trade, maintenance of drainage and peace in the city.

Occupation
 The main occupation of the Indus Civilisation people is not known. However, agriculture, handicrafts, pottery making, jewellery making, weaving, carpentry and trading were practiced.
 There were merchants, traders and artisans.
 Rearing of cattle was another occupation.
 People of those times knew how to use the potter’s wheel.
 They reared domesticated animals.

Pottery
 Pottery was practiced using the potter’s wheel. It was well fired. Potteries were red in colour with beautiful designs in black.
 The broken pieces of pottery have animal figures and geometric designs on it.

Religious Belief
We don’t have any evidence pointing to specific deities or their religious practices. There might have been worship of Mother Goddess (which symbolized fertility), which is concluded based upon the excavation of several female figurines

Toy Culture
Toys like carts, cows with movable heads and limbs, clay balls, tiny doll, a small clay
monkey, terracotta squirrels eating a nut, clay dogs and male dancer have been found.
They made various types of toys using terracotta, which show that they enjoyed playing.

The earliest form of writing was developed by Sumerians.

What happened to Harappans?
By 1900 BCE, the Harappan culture had started declining. It is assumed that the civilisation met with
¾ repeated floods
¾ ecological changes
¾ invasions
¾ natural calamity
¾ climatic changes
¾ deforestation
¾ an epidemic

Radiocarbon
Dating Method: A Standard
Tool for
Archaeologists
Also known as C14 method, the radiocarbon method uses the radioactive isotope of carbon called carbon14 to determine the age of an object.

Archaeological site at Mohenjo-Daro has been declared as a World Heritage Site by UNESCO.
