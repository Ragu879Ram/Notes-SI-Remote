Certainly! Cross-browser testing can be performed using various tools and frameworks like JUnit, TestNG, and Selenium Grid, but they differ in their approach and functionalities for achieving cross-browser compatibility.

1. **JUnit**:
   - **Cross-Browser Testing**:
     - JUnit itself doesnâ€™t have native capabilities for direct cross-browser testing. It primarily focuses on unit testing within the Java ecosystem.
     - However, JUnit can be combined with Selenium WebDriver to perform cross-browser testing. By writing test cases using Selenium WebDriver, developers can execute tests across different browsers by specifying the browser type in the WebDriver initialization.

2. **TestNG**:
   - **Cross-Browser Testing**:
     - TestNG, similar to JUnit, is primarily a testing framework that supports Java for testing purposes.
     - TestNG also integrates seamlessly with Selenium WebDriver for automated testing. TestNG's parallel execution feature allows for running tests concurrently across multiple browsers by configuring test suites to run in parallel across various browser configurations.

3. **Selenium Grid**:
   - **Cross-Browser Testing**:
     - Selenium Grid is specifically designed for parallel testing across various browsers, versions, and platforms.
     - It allows tests to be executed concurrently on different nodes (machines) with different browsers and operating systems, offering a distributed testing environment.
     - Grid enables the execution of tests written in Selenium WebDriver across multiple machines and browsers simultaneously. It's an ideal choice for comprehensive cross-browser testing, ensuring compatibility across different browser versions and environments.

**Differentiation**:

- **JUnit and TestNG**:
  - Both are testing frameworks for Java.
  - They need Selenium WebDriver to perform cross-browser testing.
  - TestNG offers advanced functionalities like parallel test execution, grouping, and parameterization out-of-the-box, which can facilitate parallel cross-browser testing more conveniently compared to JUnit.

- **Selenium Grid**:
  - Specifically designed for distributed testing across multiple environments.
  - Allows parallel execution of tests across different machines and browsers simultaneously without modifying test code extensively.
  - Grid facilitates scalable and efficient cross-browser testing by managing multiple nodes, each running tests in different configurations simultaneously.

**Summary**:
- JUnit and TestNG are primarily testing frameworks, while Selenium Grid is a tool specifically designed for distributed testing.
- JUnit and TestNG need Selenium WebDriver for cross-browser testing, whereas Selenium Grid manages multiple machines and browsers for parallel testing without significant code modifications.
- Selenium Grid is specialized for efficient cross-browser testing across multiple environments and is particularly suitable for large-scale parallel testing needs.
